The Indiana University Jetstream2 supercomputer center, where Dendra is hosted, will be performing scheduled infrastructure maintenance, which is being done in conjunction with a third party vendor to update Jetstream2’s cooling system in order to accommodate a resource expansion. This is a multi-day scheduled outage that will start on Monday and continue until Thursday. Dendra servers will be shut down gracefully between 3-5 AM Pacific Time on Monday morning to prepare.
