*Pending* - Dendra shut down gracefully. Waiting for Indiana University Jetstream2 to perform maintenance and come back online so Dendra system services can be started. {{< track "2024-04-14 09:30:00" >}}

*Resolved* - Jetstream2 maintenance completed. Power outage was longer than expected. Data center was switched to diesel power due to continued Duke Energy outage. Private networking issues are still being investigated by Jetstream2 team. Dendra system service have been restarted and validation underway. {{< track "2024-04-15 05:52:00" >}}
